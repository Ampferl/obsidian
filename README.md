# Obsidian
I restarted the project of programming an operating system.
My plan is to build a kernel that can run in user mode and handle both output and user input.
There should also be a graphical user interface with some basic applications. I'm restarting the project because I want to switch from C to C++ and because I made a lot of mistakes in the development and design of the old obsidian version.
